# K-Nearest Neighbors on Iris Dataset

## Overview
- Dataset: Iris flower dataset (150 samples, 3 classes)
- Task: Classification using KNN
- Dimensionality Reduction: PCA (2D transformation)
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, decision boundaries
- Visualization: Matplotlib decision region plotting


## Features
- Data preprocessing and train-test split
- PCA for 2D feature projection
- Training KNN classifiers with different k values
- Meshgrid-based visualization of decision boundaries
- Performance comparison across multiple k values
